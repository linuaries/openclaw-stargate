# Profile Isolation Details
# Each profile creates complete isolation:
# ├── Config: ~/.openclaw-<profile>/openclaw.json
# ├── State: ~/.openclaw-<profile>/
# ├── Port: Separate port per instance
# └── Sessions: Fully isolated context

# Resource Requirements (per article)
resources:
  memory_per_gateway: "400MB"
  total_4_gateways: "1.6GB"
  cpu_idle: "Nearly 0"
  disk_overhead: "~100MB"

# Cost Strategy
cost_optimization:
  high_value_tasks:
    - "Use O'Neill (strongest model) only for complex decisions"
    - "Route writing tasks to Jackson (cost-effective)"
    - "Keep Carter focused on technical work"
    - "Use Teal'C for final verification"

# Maintenance Schedule
maintenance:
  daily:
    - "Check gateway status"
    - "Monitor for hangs/disconnections"
  
  weekly:
    - "Review model/usage costs"
    - "Check if O'Neill being used for trivial tasks"
  
  biweekly:
    - "Review prompts for context pollution"
    - "Tighten SOUL/USER constraints if needed"

# Troubleshooting Quick Reference
troubleshooting:
  context_pollution:
    symptom: "Agent starts talking outside its role"
    solution: "Review and tighten SOUL.md constraints"
  
  gateway_hang:
    symptom: "No response, gateway appears stuck"
    solution: "Restart individual gateway, check logs"
  
  token_mismatch:
    symptom: "Gateway fails to start"
    solution: "Verify correct bot token in profile config"
  
  port_conflict:
    symptom: "Port already in use error"
    solution: "Check with 'lsof -i :<port>' and kill process"
